/*****
Program to check if two strings are anagrams or not. Two strings are given as
input and those strings have to be checked if they are anagrams or not.
Anagram means that both strings contain the same character set, only their
order is different. Therefore, in both strings, the frequency of each letter must be
the same. For example, strings "act" and "cat" are anagrams.
