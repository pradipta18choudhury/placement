/***
Program to capitalize first and last letter of each word in a line. The basic
algorithm is to keep track of the spaces and capitalize the letter before the space
and after space. The first letter and the last letter of the given line should be
capitalized.
There are only a few things that need to be considered:
 More than one occurrence of spaces between two words.
 There can be a single word like 'a' that needs to be capitalized.
 There may be two words like "me" where both letters must be capitalized.
Input: kiit university
Output: KiiT UniversitY
